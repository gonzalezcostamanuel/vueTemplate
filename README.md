# vueTemplate

The purpose of this template is to allow you to create Vue.js components without having a neat, easy-to-read structure.

## Why to use this template

If you create Vue.js components without using a template, it is easy to require more elements than originally planned for that component. This causes the elements to be placed in any order and, therefore, when you navigate between the different components of that application, situations arise such that in one of them you have first "data" and then "mounted" and finally "methods" while in another you have first "methods", then "data" and finally "mounted". 
This causes you to waste time looking for the place that each element occupies. 
Thanks to this template, all your components will follow exactly the same structure and you will get a code that is easier to debug and maintain.
